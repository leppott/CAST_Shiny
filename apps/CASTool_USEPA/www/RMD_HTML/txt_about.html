<p>The Causal Assessment Screening Tool (CASTool) is designed to assess
causes of biological impairment. CASTool is a data-driven tool that
relies on the quality and completeness of the biological response and
candidate stressor data provided by the user. It is most appropriately
used to identify candidate causes which merit additional evaluation. The
conceptual framework for the CASTool is the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agencyâ€™s Causal Analysis/Diagnosis Decision Information
System (CADDIS), which can be consulted for additional information on
causal assessment.</p>
